## Answer to the reflection questions
[x] If you had more time, what would you like to incorporate into your website? How would it improve the user's experience? What challenges would you anticipate when trying to implement the feature?
- If I had more time, I would try to add more dynamic functions that would make the website more interactive and engaging for the users. Ultimately, a website should be able to capture its audience, and adding dynamic functions is one way to achieve that. By enhancing the user experience, we can create a more engaging and enjoyable website. However, I anticipate facing some challenges in constructing these functions, particularly in using JavaScript, since some of these functions are new to me. It would take time for me to fully grasp their implementation.
[x] Why do you think web accesbility is important and why did you choose your specific features to include? The ability to find information instantly on the internet is a blessing, as it saves us time and allows us to be more productive. Additionally, it provides an opportunity to display information in a creative way, beyond the limitations of a 100-page book. I have added features to my website to enhance the user experience by making it both fun and easy to access information, consolidating it in one convenient location. It's important to make the website visually appealing, but it's also essential to ensure that it's accessible to everyone, including those with disabilities. This may involve adding alternative text for images, captions for videos, and ensuring keyboard navigation functionality. While everyone has their own idea of what's fun and appealing, it's important to design the website with the diverse needs and preferences of the audience in mind. Ultimately, the goal of web design should be to create a positive user experience for as many people as possible.
